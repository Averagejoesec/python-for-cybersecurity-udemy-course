# Using what we know so far do the following:
Have a variable with a number between 1 and 20 for the user to guess. (you can research random package if you are feeling frisky).
Using a loop, ask your user for a number between 1 and 20 (with exception handling in case they enter a string).
Check user input against the number you have stored.
When they get it correctly show a success message and end the program.
# BONUS
If you are feeling extra confident:
Track how many times the user has guessed.
Limit the number of guesses and end the program after the user has guessed too many times.
Display how many guesses the user took to get the correct answer.
